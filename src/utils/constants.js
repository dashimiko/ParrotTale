    'Hello! This site was built by me. My name is Dasha, and I am a frontend developer with a passion for parrots. In the past, I worked as a journalist, but my love for these beautiful creatures led me to combine my skills in web development with my expertise in parrot care. At the heart of my journey is Kira, my beloved 9-year-old female Cockatiel.',
    'As a hand-reared bird, Kira has become an integral part of my life. She adores carrots, and cucumbers, and spends quality time perched on my shoulder. Her favorite toy is a little bell that brings out her playful nature.',
    "Through this website, I aim to share my knowledge and experience in parrot care. Whether you're a new parrot owner or an experienced enthusiast, my blog platform is here to provide valuable insights, tips, and resources on maintaining a happy and healthy bond with your feathered companion.",
