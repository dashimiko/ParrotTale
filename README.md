# ParrotTale

_The website is under development_

ParrotTales is a blog about parrots. It's a pet project in the truest sense of the word! As a web developer with a journalism background and a love for parrots, I've combined my skills to practice coding, share my knowledge about parrots, and simply have fun. I'm also actively involved in designing this project. For the design foundation, I took inspiration from a [Figma layout](https://www.figma.com/file/rBW1MkB8NrAauPoezuL1Rn/%F0%9F%8E%A8-Creative-Website-Template-for-Figma-Community?is-community-duplicate=1&fuid=954281859369484479), but I've had to refine and adapt many elements to suit my project's needs.

## What's Inside:

- Home Page - a gallery featuring the most interesting articles, a slider describing different parrot breeds, FAQ, a feedback form, and several animations.

- Blog Page - a list of articles and tags for filtering.

- Quiz page - a "What Parrot Are You?" quiz.

- About Us Page - information about my parrot named Kira and me.

- 404 Page - a piece of CSS art, an animation of a parrot screaming "Aaaaaaa".

## Tech Stack

- React

- JavaScript

- SASS

## Libraries

- react-hook-form for form validation;

- emailjs backend-as-a-service for sending emails from the feedback form;

- pure-react-carousel for the slider;

- canvas-confetti for memorable confetti animations;

- eslint, husky and prettier for code formatting, code linting, and quality control.

## Project Status

The website is still under development. Some elements of the site may not be functional. Additionally, an adaptive layout is missing for certain screens.
